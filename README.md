# System-Info GUI Project
Built with the Eel Python library, which allows for web (HTML/CSS/JS) frontend and Python backend.
Small project to explore the library.

To launch, cd into the directory with CMD/Terminal and execute the infou.py file (must have Chrome/Chromium to launch as an App).
Can be made into an .exe with pyinstaller.
